# AWS S3 Event Triggering


**NOTE**: REPLACE YOUR AWS ACCOUNT ID IN THE LAMBDA FUNCTION CODE.
1. **Create an EC2 Instance**:
   - You started by launching an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance using the AWS Management Console.

2. **Clone Repository from GitHub**:
   - You used Git to clone your repository from GitHub to your EC2 instance. This allows you to work with your code on the AWS environment.

3. **Execute the File**:
   - You ran a file or script on your EC2 instance, which might have been part of your project. This could be any executable file.

4. **Create an S3 Bucket**:
   - Using the AWS CLI or Console, you created an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket to store objects like files or images.

5. **Create an IAM User**:
   - You created an Identity and Access Management (IAM) user, which provides specific permissions and access to AWS services.

6. **Create a Lambda Function**:
   - You deployed an AWS Lambda function, which is serverless code that can be triggered by various events.

7. **Set up an SNS Service**:
   - You configured a Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic, which allows for the distribution of messages or notifications.

8. **Authenticate Gmail**:
   - You set up authentication for a Gmail account, likely using OAuth or SMTP credentials, to enable sending notifications through email.

9. **Upload a Photo to S3**:
   - You uploaded a photo or an object to the S3 bucket created earlier.

10. **Trigger Lambda Function**:
   - The S3 bucket upload event triggered the Lambda function you created in step 6.

11. **Receive Notification**:
   - The Lambda function executed, possibly sending a notification through the SNS service to your authenticated Gmail account.

12. **Verify Successful Completion**:
   - You confirmed that you received the notification, indicating that your event-triggering project was successfully completed.

This series of steps demonstrates a well-rounded AWS project that combines EC2, Git, S3, IAM, Lambda, SNS, and Gmail authentication. Great job on completing this project! If you have any specific questions or need further assistance with any of these steps, feel free to ask.
